Interferometric Wide Swath Mode
The Interferometric Wide swath (IW) mode allows combining a large swath width (250 km) with a moderate geometric resolution (5 m by 20 m). 
The IW mode images three sub-swaths using Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR). With the TOPSAR technique, in addition to 
steering the beam in range as in SCANSAR, the beam is also electronically steered from backward to forward in the azimuth direction for each 
burst, avoiding scalloping and resulting in a higher quality image. Interferometry is ensured by sufficient overlap of the Doppler spectrum 
(in the azimuth domain) and the wave number spectrum (in the elevation domain). The TOPSAR technique ensures homogeneous image quality 
throughout the swath.

The IW mode is the default acquisition mode over land.
